	<div style="width: 70%;">
		<p style="text-align:center;">
		While anxiety symptoms vary widely, odds are good that at some point you've experienced occasional physical and emotional distress signals such as panicky
		breathing, your heart pounding in your chest, trouble sleeping, feelings of dread, or even loops of worry. That's normal. 
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:center;">
		By itself, anxiety isn't a problem. It anchors the protective biological response to danger that boosts heartbeat and breathing, pumping oxygenated blood
		to your muscles as your body prepares to fight or flee. A dollop of healthy anxiety can persuade you to get to work on time, push you to study hard for an
		exam, or discourage you from wandering dark streets alone.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:center;">
		"Experiencing anxiety is normal," says Dr. Gene Beresin, executive director of the Clay Center for Healthy Young Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
		"A certain amount of anxiety can even be helpful. The problem is that sometimes the systems underlying our anxiety responses get dysregulated, so that we
		overreact or react to the wrong situations."

	Severity of symptoms and a person's ability to cope separate everyday worries or anxious moments from anxiety disorders.

	As with every health issue, an accurate diagnosis is essential. A few common anxiety disorders include:
	</p>
	
	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<ul><li style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Generalized anxiety disorder:</li></ul>
			<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
			A pattern of excessive worry about a variety of issues on most days for at least six months, often accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle
			tension, a hammering heart, or dizziness.

			Panic attacks are sudden, intense episodes of heart-banging fear, breathlessness, and dread. "It's the feeling you'd have if you just missed being hit

	<h1 style="margin-bottom:0;">The costs of anxiety</h1>
	<hr><br>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
	Constant anxiety levies a toll on health. For example, anxiety increases levels of the stress hormone cortisol, raising blood pressure, which contributes over 
	time to heart problems, stroke, kidney disease, and sexual dysfunction. And a 2017 Lancet study using brain scans measured activity in an area called the 
	amygdala, which mounts split-second responses to danger and encodes memories of frightening events. Greater activity in the amygdala correlated with higher
	risk for heart disease and stroke, possibly, the researchers speculated, by triggering immune system production of extra white cells to fight perceived threats.
	In people struggling with emotional stress, this might drive inflammation and plaque formation that leads to heart attacks and strokes.
	</p>
	<p>
	Quality of life suffers, too. Intrusive thoughts, dread of panic attacks, intense self-consciousness and fear of rejection, and other hallmarks of anxiety
	disorders compel people to avoid anxiety-provoking situations. This interferes with relationships, work, school, and activities as people isolate themselves, 
	turn down opportunities, and forgo possible joys in life.
	</p>

<div class="container">

	<h1 style="margin-bottom:0;">There are effective treatments for anxiety</h1>
	<hr>
	
	<p>
	Treatment is tailored to the diagnosis. Effective options include:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lifestyle changes, </span>
	such as skipping caffeine, exercising regularly, and avoiding medicines or substances that might cause anxiety symptoms.
	</li><br>
	
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mind-body approaches, </span>
	such as deep breathing, meditation, mindfulness, and techniques to ease muscle tension and promote calm.
	</li><br>
	
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Psychotherapy, </span>
	such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy. CBT teaches people to challenge and reframe distorted or unhelpful anxious thinking, because 
	thoughts influence feelings and actions. Exposure therapy helps people tolerate and calm anxiety by gradually exposing a person to feared situations or objects
	under guidance from a therapist.
	</li><br>
	
	<li>
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">Medicines, </span>
	such as short-acting drugs called benzodiazepines, which are taken as needed when anxiety spikes. Low doses of some antidepressants, particularly selective 
	serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), help relieve anxiety when taken daily.
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	Often, a combination of approaches is best. Relieving anxiety with medicine while using CBT or exposure therapy to strengthen coping skills and help retrain the
	brain can do much to make anxiety manageable.
	</p>
