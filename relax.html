			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">1. Shout it out</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Talking to a trusted friend is one way to cope with anxiety. But there is something even better than talking:
			screaming at the top of your lungs. As a kid, you were probably taught not to shout and told to use your "inside voice".
			But as an adult, you can make your own rules. So if you are dealing with pent-up frustrations and anxiety, let it out. 
			</p>
			<p>
			This does not mean putting fear in others so they feel on edge like you. We are talking about a healthy release of emotions
			in a controlled environment. The more you fight anxiety, the more overwhelming it can become. Instead, embrace anxiety as a part
			of your life, and then let it go. Scream at the top of your lungs, punch a pillow, stomp your feet, or pound your chest. Do whatever
			helps you get it out! 
			</p>

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">3. Break up with caffeine</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			A cup of coffee, chocolate, or an ice-cold Coke might help you feel better. But if caffeine is your go-to drug of choice, your anxiety 
			could worsen. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Caffeine gives the nervous system a jolt, which can boost energy levels. But when under pressure, this nervous energy can induce an anxiety 
			attack. Now, the idea of giving up your favorite caffeinated beverage might raise your heart rate and induce anxiety as you read this, but you 
			do not have to give up caffeine completely. It is all about moderation.
			</p>
			<p>
			Rather than four cups of coffee a day, scale back to one or two normal-sized cups a day —normal as in 8 ounces, not 16 or 32 ounces. Give it a test 
			run and see how you feel. As you wean yourself, slowly introduce other beverages into your diet such as decaffeinated herbal tea, which can calm your 
			mind and nerves.
			</p>

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">5. Feel OK saying no</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Your plate is only so big, and if you overwhelm yourself with everyone else's personal problems, your anxiety will also worsen. We have all heard the 
			adage, "There is more happiness in giving than receiving." But nowhere in this sentence does it say you should sit back and let others infringe on your 
			time.
			</p>
			<p>
			Whether you are driving someone around on errands, picking up their kids from school, or lending an ear about their problems, you will have little strength 
			to care for your personal affairs if you spend almost all your energy caring for others. This doesn't mean you should never help anyone, but know your 
			limitations, and do not be afraid to say "no" when you need to.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card slide-in-left">
			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">7. Give yourself an exit strategy</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Sometimes, anxiety is due to feeling out of control. You can't always be in the driver seat of your life, but you can take steps to identify your 
			triggers and cope with circumstances that cause anxiety. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Does the thought of going into a social situation or meeting new people make you want to jump off a bridge? As everyone at a party engages in exciting 
			conversations, maybe you see yourself holding up the wall and counting down the seconds until you are put out of your misery. You drove with friends and 
			cannot leave, so you spend the entire night looking like the punchbowl attendant. It is this fear that makes you decline invitations and sleep through the 
			weekends. 
			</p>
			<p>
			But what if you had an exit strategy in place before leaving the house? For example, instead of carpooling with your party animal friends, you could 
			drive yourself. This way, you can leave if your anxiety starts to build and you can't handle another minute of awkward interactions. The more in control
			you feel, the less anxiety you'll have.

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">2. Get moving</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Exercise is probably the last thing you want to do when your mind is in overdrive. You may worry about post-workout soreness and 
			being unable to walk or sit for the next two days. Or your mind might go to the worst-case scenario and you fear overexerting yourself and 
			having a heart attack. But in reality, exercise is one of the best natural anti-anxiety solutions.
			</p>
			<p>
			Physical activity raises endorphins and serotonin levels to help you feel better emotionally. And when you feel better on the inside, your 
			entire outlook improves. And because your brain cannot equally focus on two things at once, exercise can also take your mind off your problems. 
			Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity three to five days a week. Do not think you have to struggle through a painful workout. 
			Any type of movement is good, so put on your favorite jam and move around the house. Or grab a mat and break out into your favorite yoga poses.
			</p>

		<div class="card slide-in-right">
			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">4. Give yourself a bedtime</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			With your busy schedule, there is no time for sleep, right? Some workaholics brag about only needing three or four hours of sleep a night, as if to 
			say, "I am more determined and committed than everyone else." But no matter what you might tell yourself, you are not a robot. Humans need sleep to 
			function properly, so unless you beamed in from some nearby planet, this also applies to you. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Whether you deal with insomnia, purposely limit your amount of sleep, or you are a self-professed night owl, chronic sleep deprivation makes you 
			susceptible to anxiety. Do yourself (and everyone around you) a favor and get eight to nine hours of sleep every night. Develop a bedtime routine 
			to read a book or do something relaxing before bed. The better prepared you are to get a good night’s sleep, the better quality of sleep you’ll have, 
			which leads to a better morning as well. 
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card slide-in-right">
			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">6. Do not skip meals</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			If anxiety causes nausea, the thought of eating food is as appealing as eating dirt. But skipping meals can make anxiety worse. Your blood sugar drops 
			when you do not eat, which causes the release of a stress hormone called cortisol. Cortisol can help you perform better under pressure, but it can also
			make you feel worse if you are already prone to anxiety. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The fact that you need to eat does not justify stuffing just anything in your mouth, so this is not an excuse to overindulge in sugar and junk food. Sugar
			does not cause anxiety, but a sugar rush can cause physical symptoms of anxiety, such as nervousness and shaking. And if you begin to obsess over a
			reaction to sugar, you could have an out-all panic attack. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Incorporate more lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats into your diet. Eat five to six small meals throughout the day, and avoid or limit
			your intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates.
			</p>

		<div class="card slide-in-right">
			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">8. Live in the moment</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Other than the words on this page, what are you thinking about right now? Are you worried about a meeting you have next week? Are you stressed about 
			meeting your financial goals? Or maybe you are obsessing over whether you'll be a good parent - although you have zero kids and have no plans to conceive 
			in the near future. 
			</p>
			<p>
			If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you have just uncovered part of the problem. Like many others with anxiety disorders, you have trouble 
			living in the moment. Instead of worrying about today, you're already thinking about tomorrow's problems. And depending on the severity of your anxiety,
			you might be stressing about yesterday's mistakes. 
			</p>
			<p>
			You cannot control the future, and you cannot borrow a time machine and change the past, so here is a thought: Take each day as it comes. Not to say you 
			can't be proactive and head off problems. But do not put too much focus on what has been and what will be that you create anxiety for yourself.
			Mindfulness and meditation are rooted in living in the moment and have been proven to ease anxiety. Try practicing for a few minutes a day and increase 
			the duration over time. The best part? You can do it anywhere: in bed, at your work desk, or even on the commute home.
