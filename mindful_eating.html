	<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px;">Mindful Eating</h1>
	
	<center>
	<div style="width: 70%;">
		<p style="text-align:center;">
		Mindful eating places awareness on the menu, whenever and wherever we eat. As well as making us watchful about what we eat, it aims to transform our relationship 
		with food by focusing on the how and why of eating, encouraging a more holistic point of view. Ultimately, this means we have a better chance of understanding 
		what foods nourish us and what foods help us stay healthy while also encouraging a deeper appreciation of every meal, every mouthful, and every ingredient.

	<h1>Knowing what your body needs</h1>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
	In its fullest sense, mindfulness means not only being present but also curious and interested, with a willingness to explore how and why we think and feel the
	way we do — without judgment. This is no more apropos than when it comes to our eating habits. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Think about the questions most people don’t ask themselves: How hungry am I actually? What does my body need? How satiated do I feel halfway through this meal? 
	Am I scarfing down my food or enjoying it? Am I denying myself food I like because I think it’s “bad”? Is this portion too much or not enough? 
	Awareness is something we can also bring to the supermarket and the kitchen. It helps us learn not to make choices that are automatically influenced by external 
	thoughts, emotions, or impulses but instead by our own internal knowledge of what our bodies need.
	</p>
	<p>
	The mind is powerful, and when left untrained, it can be a susceptible to both emotion and habit. We meditate to train the mind — to find the space to make
	better choices in the interests of our overall health, not our body shape or weight. And the starting point for that shift in perspective is one simple 
	question: What’s your relationship to food?
	</p>

	<h1>The benefits of mindful eating</h1>

	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			The benefits of mindful eating will, of course, be subjective. What’s healthy for one person might not be healthy for another. What’s clear is that
			“healthy” isn’t defined by body weight or shape. Someone weighing 220 lbs. could be eating healthier than someone at 180 lbs. Thinness does not equal 
			healthy in the same way fatness cannot be conflated to mean unhealthy. It's with this kind of perspective—this kind of awareness—that we come to
			discover renewed confidence, freedom, and self-acceptance.
			</p>
			<p>
			The scientific research exploring mindful eating is primarily focused on weight loss and recovery from disordered eating, and it generally shows a
			positive benefit. A growing body of research suggests that a more considered way of eating steers people away from unhealthy choices.
			</p>
			<p>
			A recent review of the literature concluded that mindful eating promotes not only positive eating behaviors but also leads to moderate and sustained 
			weight loss for those trying to lose weight. Studies suggest that a more considered way of eating steers people away from unhealthy choices. 
			The difficulty with diets, as demonstrated by other research, is that most people lose weight in the first year, but the vast majority regain that
			weight within the following five years. That initial weight loss is often considered a “success story” nevertheless. Mindful eating is about a 
			long-term, sustainable approach to eating, without restrictions, where weight loss isn’t the goal but can be a by-product. Indeed, for some people,
			especially those who have been on restrictive diets, it might even mean adding on a little healthy weight.

	<h1>Try the 7-days of mindful eating plan</h1>
	<p>
	Our eating behaviors have more to them than we might think. So before digging in, use this guide to find the perfect mindful eating tips and tools for 
	whatever might be driving you.
	</p>
	
	<h2 style="color: #0c43ca; margin-bottom: 0;">Day 1: Jot down your plan</h2>
	
	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			At the start of your week, jot down a quick food plan for yourself. Maybe you’ll plan to eat out every night, or try a new ingredient every day.
			You can note it for yourself in your head, but writing it down will help to focus your intentions, and remove the pressure of making food decisions
			in the moment throughout the week. Keep your plan in mind while you’re shopping or picking up your food.

	<h2 style="color: #0c43ca;">Day 2: Pause and reflect</h2>
	
	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Halfway through a meal today, take a break to check in with your body. From 1-10, how full do you feel? If you’re still hungry, then go for it! If 
			you’re not, pause, and save your meal for tomorrow or second breakfast or come back to it later when you’re hungry again — leftovers are great.
			</p>

	<h2 style="color: #0c43ca;">Day 3: Have a seat</h2>
	
	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			When you can, sit down to eat your food without multi-tasking, even if it’s just a snack. Sitting down and simply eating helps limit your distractions, 
			but most importantly, lets you focus on every delicious bite. It may feel weird at first to eat without doing anything else, but it helps us helps us
			understand our emotional connection to food.

	<h2 style="color: #0c43ca;">Day 4: Handy Reminders</h2>
	
	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			It’s unbelievably hard to remember to eat mindfully — especially when you’re eyeing down a delicious meal after a long day. Consider tying a string
			around your wrist or wearing a certain bracelet or ring as a gentle reminder to eat mindfully.
			</p>

	<h2 style="color: #0c43ca;">Day 5: Engage your senses</h2>
	
	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			The next time you’re eating, take your first bite with your eyes closed. Notice the texture, the sound of the crunch, and every delicious smell and 
			flavor. What do the textures feel like? What do you enjoy about it?
			</p>

	<h2 style="color: #0c43ca;">Day 6: Be kind to yourself</h2>
	
	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			If you don’t have time or energy to approach every meal mindfully, that’s OK. Be gentle and forgiving with yourself — there’s always another meal to
			approach mindfully around the corner. Try not to think of food as being good or bad. It’s all just food! Food has no moral value, it’s simply delicious 
			fuel that your body needs.

	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="left-ed">
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Like meditation, mindful eating is a skill that takes consistent practice. Keep the tips you’ve learned in mind (or explore the additional tips below)
			and practice whenever you can.
